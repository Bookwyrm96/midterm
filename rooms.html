<title>Our Rooms</title>
    <h1>Main Room</h1>
        <p>Our Main Room is along the north driveway, adjacent to the Charleston Shopping Center (see map below).</p>
        <p>In this room, hardbound books start at $1 each and paperback books at 50 cents each.</p>
        <p>Because of our severe space limitations and compelling issues of health and safety, we will only allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time.</p>
        <p>Once inside, customers may take only 12 books off of shelves, after which they should purchase these and exit via the east door. They may then join at the end of any remaining line at the north door and re-enter in that order.</p>    
        <p><strong>Please bring your Large Book Donations to this room.</strong></p>
    <h1>Children's Room</h1>
        <p>Children's Books, Music, Videos, and Toys are in our New Room (near the Cubberley track, Pavilion and the Greendell School)</p>
            <p>Here you'll find many items for 50 cents or $1, including:</p>
