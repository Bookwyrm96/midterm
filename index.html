        <p>  
        We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, and magazines that have been donated by the community, as well as items that the Palo Alto library has removed from their shelves to make room for new purchases. 
        </p>
    <p>
        On Saturday, during the first hour of the sale, please select no more than 12 books at a time, and bring them to the cashiers to hold until you are ready to pay for all your purchases.

    <h3 id="article-title">Number Tickets</h3>
        <p> Beginning at 8am Saturday Morning, a maximum of two numbered tickets per person are handed out in the Main Room. Feel free to arrive early to assure your space in line.</p>
        <p>If you receive a ticket, the number on it reserves your corresponding place in the line, allowing you to go off and get coffee or to visit the Children's and Bargain Book rooms. </p> 
        <p>Please be sure to return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your spot in the line:<strong> if you miss the time when your number is allowed to enter the Main Room you will forfeit your place in line.</strong></p>
        <p>If you donâ€™t arrive in time to get a ticket, please just join the latter part of the line.</p>
