        We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our monthly sale. These are mostly from donations from individuals, estates, and companies. We also sell items that the Palo Alto library has removed from their shelves to make room for new purchases. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On Saturday, during the first hour of the sale, please select no more than 12 books at a time, and bring them to the cashiers to hold until you are ready to pay for all your purchases.
